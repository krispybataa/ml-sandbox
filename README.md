## 🧪 Experimentation Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. **Version Control**: Always commit your experiments
2. **Documentation**: Document your findings and insights
3. **Reproducibility**: Set random seeds for consistent results
4. **Validation**: Use proper train/validation/test splits
5. **Metrics**: Track multiple evaluation metrics

### Experiment Tracking
- Use MLflow for experiment tracking
- Log hyperparameters and metrics
- Save model artifacts
- Document model performance

## 📊 Data Management

### Data Sources
- Public datasets (Kaggle, UCI, etc.)
- Synthetic data generation
- Web scraping (when appropriate)
- API data collection

### Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Encoding categorical variables
- Outlier detection and treatment

## 🔧 Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch** for each experiment
2. **Write tests** for your ML pipeline
3. **Document your approach** in notebooks
4. **Compare results** with baseline models
5. **Share findings** with the community

## 📝 Contributing

### Adding New Experiments
1. Create a new notebook in `notebooks/`
2. Follow the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_experiment_name.ipynb`
3. Include clear documentation and comments
4. Add any new dependencies to `requirements.txt`

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions
- Keep functions small and focused

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Data Privacy**: Never commit sensitive or personal data
- **Resource Management**: Monitor memory and compute usage
- **Backup**: Regularly backup important experiments
- **Security**: Be cautious with API keys and credentials
